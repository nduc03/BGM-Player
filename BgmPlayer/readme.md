**Only applied for me config**

 - Add a blank file (without extension) named `disable_ost_name` into data folder (`BGM_Player_Data`) to
   disable translating title from in-game name to OST name.
 - In case the file is added or removed while the music is playing, the
   title won't be updated until it stops and plays again.
